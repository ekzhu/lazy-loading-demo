"""
Meta package for my-framework.

Installing this package will automatically install:
- my-framework (core framework with lazy loading)
- my-framework-ext (extension package)

This is a convenience package for users who want the complete framework
with all extensions in one installation command:

    pip install my-framework-complete

Instead of:

    pip install my-framework
    pip install my-framework-ext
